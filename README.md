#NSS JQuery Slideshow

###Instructions

Slideshows should have the following features:

 - Arrow buttons to navigate between images 
 - An auto-rotate feature that navigates through the images on a loop 
 - A caption for each image
 - A fade in and fade out animation.
 - A consistent height and width, regardless of the size or dimensions of the images being shown.

###Bonus
1. Allow the user to change the animation from fade in/out to slide in/out.
2. Have captions only appear on hover.
